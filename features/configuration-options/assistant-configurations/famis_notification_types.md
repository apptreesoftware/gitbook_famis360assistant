# famis\_notification\_types

This configuration indicates the type of notification methods which the user will receive alerts.  Options are:

* push
* sms
* email

The notification method **`push`** is the most common one configured for projects

{% hint style="warning" %}
What notifications are sent by the assistant?
{% endhint %}

On creation of the work request, the task that creates the WO in FAMIS360 also pushes a notification to the assistant letting them know the new work request has been created.

No notifications are sent when the work request is updated/edited.
